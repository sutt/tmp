    "I have 10 pairs of socks in a drawer. Each pair is distinct from another and consists of two matching socks. Alas, I’m negligent when it comes to folding my laundry, and so the socks are not folded into pairs. This morning, fumbling around in the dark, I pull the socks out of the drawer, randomly and one at a time, until I have a matching pair of socks among the ones I’ve removed from the drawer.\n",

Well, since you’re in a hurry, you just write down everything in the percentage that comes before the decimal point. So for example, 35.0 percent, 35.17 percent and 35.92 percent would all be written simply as “35 percent.”\n",

Your first realization is that you work with a bunch of cheaters who voted more than once. But your second thought is that you might be able to use this information to figure out how many people work in your office. (As I said, you’re new, and this isn’t something you know off the top of your head.)\n",
